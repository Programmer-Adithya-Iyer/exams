## 📊 Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
- **Definition:** Process to evaluate likely environmental impacts of a project.
- **Stages:**
  1. Screening → need for EIA.
  2. Scoping → identify key impacts.
  3. Assessment → predict impacts, alternatives.
  4. Reporting → Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).
  5. Review → public + authority participation.
  6. Decision‑making → approve/reject project.
  7. Monitoring → compliance, auditing.
- **Baseline Situation:** Existing environmental condition before project.

# Unit 4: Human Population and Environment

---

## 👥 Population Growth
- **Definition:** Rapid increase in human numbers due to high birth rates, declining death rates, and improved longevity.
- **Factors:**
  - Fertility rate (average children per woman).
  - Infant mortality rate.
  - Longevity (life expectancy).
- **Trends:**
  - Global population ~8 billion (2025).
  - Developing countries → fastest growth.
  - Life expectancy: 46 yrs (1950) → 65 yrs (2000) → projected 75 yrs (2050).
- **Consequences:**
  - Resource depletion, pollution, unemployment, poverty, deforestation, climate change.
- **Control Measures:**
  - Family planning, education, raising marriage age, women empowerment, awareness.

---

## 📜 Human Rights
- **Definition:** Fundamental rights inherent to all humans regardless of caste, creed, gender, or nationality.
- **Key Principles:**
  - Equality, social justice, dignity, freedom.
  - Right to clean environment, safe food, water, health.
- **Environmental Link:**
  - Access to natural resources (fuelwood, water, forest products).
  - Protection against pollution and degradation.
- **Issues:**
  - Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) → biopiracy cases (Neem, Turmeric).
  - Equity in resource distribution.
- **Constitutional Provisions (India):**
  - Article 51A(g): Duty to protect environment.
  - Article 48A: State shall protect forests and wildlife.

## 👨‍👩‍👧 Family Welfare Programmes
- **Definition:** Government initiatives to stabilize population and improve quality of life.
- **History:**

  - Renamed *National Family Welfare Programme* in 1977.
- **Objectives:**
  - Promote small family norm.
  - Provide education, nutrition, health, shelter, safe drinking water.
- **Strategies:**
  - Integration with health services.
  - Emphasis on spacing methods (IUD, pills, condoms).
  - Incentives, awareness campaigns, mass media.
- **Impact:**
  - Increased contraceptive awareness (sterilization, condoms, pills).
  - Decline in infant mortality and fertility rates.

---

## 🏥 Environment and Human Health
- **Interdependence:** Healthy environment → healthy humans.
- **Major Issues:**
  - Waterborne diseases (diarrhea, cholera, typhoid).
  - Vector-borne diseases (malaria, dengue).
  - Air pollution → respiratory diseases, cancers.
  - Noise pollution → stress, hypertension.
- **Solutions:**
  - Safe drinking water, sanitation, nutrition.
  - Pollution control, renewable energy.
  - Public health programmes (vaccination, ORS for diarrhea).
- **Case Study:** TB in India → 26.9 lakh patients, National TB Elimination Programme (goal: 2025).
